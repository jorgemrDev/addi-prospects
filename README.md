# ADDI prospects application

prospects application

For the fake API calls i created async functions (located at ./services folder) that reads from json files (all located on ./data folder, there are a file for every sevice crm, judicial records, national registry)

Unit testing is implemented using Jest and snapshots

for tests you can use this document numbers:

- 80913296: happy path, this user doesnt have judicial records and the data CRM database is same as on national registry
- 80913297: this user have judicial records
- 80913298: this user have a different birthdate on crm than on national registry
- 80913299: for this user all data on CRM is different than on national registry

NOTE: in all cases including happy path can be raised the non prospect qualification score validation as that value is random

you can use that documents to test or feel free to modify the data on the json files

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
